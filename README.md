# IPA

## Abstract

Within the scope of the individual practical exam (IPA), I was given an exciting task. It requires the combination of the topics of optics and metrology and a detailed computer-aided data evaluation was used, too.

For the research project “HERO” I am developing an overlap monitor, which measures thetemporal and spatial overlap of a laser and electron beam. To determine the temporal resolution of the overlap monitor, a detailed characterization of the utilised photodiode and the subsequent measurement chain is necessary. This preliminary study can easily be partitioned off from the rest of the development work and is therefore suitable for the IPA.

During the twelve-day IPA I analysed the influence of photodiodes, amplifiers, cables and evaluation algorithms on the temporal resolution. For this purpose, I designed different setups to separate the individual influences. I evaluated the obtained measurement data and interpreted them in a detailed measurement protocol. I also documented my development process in this documentation.

The knowledge gained is very valuable for the further development of the overlap monitor. It shows the optimisation opportunities and the limits of the arrival time measurement.
